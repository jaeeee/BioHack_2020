                      Welcome back to a new quarter! We hope you all had a
                      wonderful spring break. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic,
                      we are sad to announce that BioHack 2020 will be canceled.
                      We were as excited as you were about this yearâ€™s
                      hackathon, and are as equally disappointed about these
                      turn of events. Though BioHack is not able to happen this
                      year, we wanted to extend our sincere gratitude for your
                      participation up to this point and thank you for your
                      enthusiasm in this event. Here are some resources to help
                      you navigate through this crisis:

                      disappointment, and thank you very much for your
                      participation thus far. We promise to bring you a bigger
                      and better BioHack in 2021! If you have any questions or

                      considerate to your fellow peers during these uncertain
                      times. Until then, we eagerly look forward to the day we
                      can all gather again!
